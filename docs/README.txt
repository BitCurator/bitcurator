---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<http://wiki.bitcurator.net>

# Getting started

BitCurator is a research and development effort designed to bring digital forensics tools and techniques to archives, libraries, and other collecting institutions. The simplest way to get up and running with tools developed by the BitCurator team (and 3rd party tools packaged by us) is to download our virtual machine.

The most current BitCurator virtual machine can be downloaded from

  https://wiki.bitcurator.net/

The default username and password for the virtual machine are as follows:

* Username: `bcadmin`
* Password: `bcadmin`

# Installing BitCurator from scratch

The core BitCurator tools have been tested in Ubuntu 12.04LTS. To clone the master BitCurator repository, run:

* git clone https://github.com/kamwoods/bitcurator

The installation script bc-install.sh will install required dependencies, the BitCurator Python tools, and other supporting software. (Note: In pre-1.0 releases, this script is a work-in-progress)

* ./bc-install.sh
