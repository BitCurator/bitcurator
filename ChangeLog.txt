BitCurator 0.7.6 released
This is a maintenance release that addresses an issue in the File Access tab of the BitCurator reporting tool where disk images located under certain paths could not be accessed.

February 18, 2014
BitCurator 0.7.4 released
- The mounting scripts have been fixed to mount disk images - without asking for authentication - from all locations.
- The desktop now includes a folder named "Shared Folders and Media" that points to the /media directory. When users adds a host shared folder, it will automatically appear in this location with an "sf_"  prefix.
- ClamTK is now linked in the Additional Tools folder.
- The filint tool is also now linked in the Additional Tools folder as a convenience for keeping the VM clean.
- The ficlam scripts, which run ClamAV scans during a fiwalk run, are now in the /Tools/ficlam directory, and there is a slide showing how to run them in the Quickstart guide.
- A dd command-line launcher has been added to the Imaging Tools directory

February 2, 2014
BitCurator 0.7.0 released
- File Export tab added to GUI. This new tab runs fiwalk and uses the output to generate a tree-style hierachy of the file system in a new window. This allows you to safely navigate through directory and file contents and export file items without having to mount the file system.
- Removes bugs affecting the operation of the fiwalk and annotation tabs in the BitCurator GUI.
- Updates The Sleuth Kit to 4.1.3.
- Now includes ClamTK, a graphical front-end to the Clam virus scanner. ClamTK simplifies the process of scanning mounted file systems and regular directory contents.
