The py3fpdf code is no longer actively maintained by its creator. The source is included here as a support library for PDF output produced by the BitCurator reporting tools. py3fpdf should be installed from the py3fpdf directory prior to these tools in order for the reports to generate correctly, using the following commands:

python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install
