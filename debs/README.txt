An ns-control file is included in the bc-meta diretory as a convenience for future maintenance
or provision of a bitcurator .deb package. No .deb is currently being provided as part of
this repository.

An up-to-date list of dependencies is also provided in the bitcurator-bootstrap repository,
which includes scripts to build and upgrade the BitCurator environment.

For the time being, the ns-control has been moved to the "attic" directory, as it is out of date
with respect to the dependencies found in bitcurator-bootstrap.
